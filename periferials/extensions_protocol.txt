to use the v1 extension protocol we use UART to send data or get data from the robot.
first we need to configure the controller. you may ask why? well its for the controller to know what data to send,if using programable pins.
commands to set something start with $ commands that get start with %.
configuring should look something like this(send on uart).
$c 0,gyro distance,additional_sensors
$c = configure
0 = we don't use high current programable pins
gyro and distance = we want to get data from gyro and the distance sensor
if you dont want to use anything just send $c without args
so the command is like this
$c <pins>,<get values>,<module_name>
so commands should look something like this
<command> <args>
to program out pins we use $p command
$p <pin number>,<value>
to get the data we configured we use
%g
and wait for it to return the data
we can send data to the raspberry but for that custom driver is required and we need to add the module identifier to the configure.
we just add the module name to the configuration like shown in the example.
how to write a driver for your module is in the drivers.txt file
